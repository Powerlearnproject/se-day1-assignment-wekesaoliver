Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Invention of the High-Level Programming Language (1950s-1960s)

Prior to high-level languages, programmers had to write directly in machine code, which was extremely complex and error-prone.
High-level languages (e.g., FORTRAN, COBOL) introduced a more human-readable syntax, allowing programmers to focus on the logic of their programs rather than the underlying machine instructions.
This milestone significantly increased the efficiency and productivity of software development.
2. Adoption of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s)

Traditional programming paradigms, such as procedural programming, resulted in monolithic code that was difficult to maintain and extend.
Object-oriented programming introduced the concept of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing programmers to organize code into reusable and modular components.
OOP significantly improved the structure and maintainability of software systems, making complex development tasks easier to manage.
3. Emergence of Agile Software Development (1990s-2000s)

Traditional software development processes were often slow and inflexible, resulting in software that did not meet customer needs.
Agile methods, such as Scrum and Kanban, emphasized iterative development, customer collaboration, and continuous improvement.
Agile methodologies have revolutionized software development by promoting flexibility, adaptability, and faster time-to-market for software products.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning and Requirements Gathering:
